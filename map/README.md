# Map Config

These scripts are basic configuration files specific to the map or mod that are used by default. The idea is for server admins to use the `/override` folder files to override these settings. See `/override/README.md` for more information on how to use overrides.

For example, if a developer ports this mission to a new map or mod with different weapons or vehicles they can set the default gun store and vehicle store contents, then admins can override those settings if they desire.
